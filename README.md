Applications of Binary 
Binary heaps hold significant importance as they implement sorting and prioritizing algorithms more efficient
Priority Queues -used to schedule tasks events and graph algorithms like prims.
Heapsort Algorithm - It constructs a max heap(ascending) and min-heap(descending)using an input array and then extracts the max(min) respectively.
